# vral
This is supposed to detect coughing sounds in lecture recording (but we're not finished with it yet...)

But for now, at least, you can run in terminal: $python rosa-tensorflow.py [name of a audio file]

and it should give you a pretty visualization of your audio file. Make sure you have numpy and librosa installed.


Next time, hopefully we can use TensorFlow to make this much better!


If you're using virtual environment in Python
https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/

`virtualenv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
